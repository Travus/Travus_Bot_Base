            "them. For more info on what the commands do, check their help entry.\n\n*Sudo Command*\nThis command "
            "takes up to 3 arguments. The first is a user. The second argument is a channel, but this can be "
            "omitted. The bot will try to resolve the channel, if this fails it will fall back to the channel the "
            "command was used in, then it will consider the second argument to be the third, namely the command "
            "to be executed. This means in practice that unless the command starts with something that would "
            "resolve as a channel the second argument can be omitted if the current channel is the target channel."
            "\n\n*Eval Command*\nThis command runs code. Code can be either be passed directly following the "
            "command, or in a single or multi-line code block. Multi-line code blocks both with and without "
            "syntax highlighting are supported, however the start and end of the code block (i.e. \\`\\`\\`) has "
            "to be on separate lines from the code. The bot will respond with all regular output streams and the "
            "return value if there is one. If there is no output, the bot will not respond.\n\n*Roleids/"

            "keyword `all` or alternatively the reference to either a channel or role based on which command is "
            "used. Then optionally a channel can be given as a second argument, and the response will be sent in "
            "this channel. The channel can be in another server entirely as long as both the user and the bot "
            "have access there. If the keyword `dm` is used then the response will be sent in the user's DMs with "
